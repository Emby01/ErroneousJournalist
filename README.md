# ErroneousJournalist (previously Starr_y)

Some random website I created while trying to test my HTML + CSS skills.

## From aboutus.html

This is ErroneousJournalist, a small website that randomly makes random news articles only using raw HTML and CSS
(and maybe JavaScript in the future). ErroneousJournalist's articles are definitely bias-free and are totally a trustworthy source
of information.

Also on the point of how we (I) make this website, every part of the website is manually created (for now.) The "read next",
the text, the title and navbar (navigation bar)... they're all made manually. Like they don't automatically or
dynamically update or any fancy stuff, if I want to add an article to the "read next" sidebar like... idk, a new news article,
I have to go to every single HTML file and add it on all of those. Kinda annoying, am i right?

I started this project in like 2020 or something when I got bored and I discovered what HTML was. Then I randomly stopped in
late 2020 and early 2021, and I found this website again in late 2021 and worked on it across 2022. So yeah that's where
the website is at now.

This website was made 5% in Komodo Edit and the rest just Visual Studio Code (ignoring GitHub commits). In 2022 I uploaded the code for this website onto GitHub, which was linked above. Uploading this onto GitHub allowed me to use source control (Git) and also
collaborate with my (non-existent) friends.

Originally this website was called "Starr_y" because I couldn't figure out a better name for the website. Either way it doesn't matter, because in 2022 I renamed it to ErroneousJournalist. Which in my opinion is a much better name.

This entire project has basically been manned by one person, me! Well until I put it onto GitHub, but still basically no contributions since then. So yeah if you want to change that open a pull request on GitHub or smth idk.

So yeah. That's it. Welcome to ErroneousJournalist. Just doing journalism or whatever that word is. Remember it's all
irrelevant and also erroneous. Enjoy the bad UI design and useless pointless articles, and the read next bar that never updates,
or the footer that doesn't exist, the terrible logo made in Canva, the navbar taken from w3schools, and so on.

Hey, at least there's no advertisements!
