                    Professor Gagandeep Sodhi, a science teacher who works at Bruh University, noticed that potatoes are very good. People are always criticising the work of
                    Bruh University's teachers, and Professor Gagandeep Sodhi wanted to finally prove that they were right. He lately researched an extremely controversial topic, 
                    which was the question:

                    Well, Gagandeep wanted to prove something for once. He decided to research very deeply into this question. He researched all the different parts of this question,
                    including the following:
