                In breaking news, Andy, a student from Erroneous Creations High, has been hit by a dodgeball. He has suffered critical injuries to the chest and legs, and is currently in a stable state at ErroneousHospital.
                </p>
                <p>
                The tragic event started during a dangerous and heated match of dodgeball between the Erroneous Creations High Dodgeball Team and the Amogus High School Dodgeball Team. According to anonymous witnesses, Andy was carrying the team. Other sources state that he was the prime target of the enemy team.

                Amogus High School's team's star player, Bully Maguire, had his eyes on Andy for most of the game until the incident occurred. His teammates stated that he missed a few easy shots at Andy, and was looking more puffed and angry every time he missed.

                What happened next is summarised by Andy's fellow teammate Rebeen.

                Andy's parents are attempting to sue either Amogus High School or Maguire's parents for a total of $500,000. According to Amogus High School's deputy principal Mr. Wick, Maguire is currently being suspended from school and is being sent to a juvenile corrective service.
